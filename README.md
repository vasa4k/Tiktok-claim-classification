# Tiktok-claim-classification
This project focuses on classifying TikTok videos into "claim" or "opinion" categories using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques and a Decision Tree model. The goal is to predict whether a TikTok video makes a factual claim or expresses an opinion based on its content.

# Key Features
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Utilizes data exploration techniques to gain insights into the distribution and characteristics of TikTok video content.

**Feature Engineering:**
Includes extracting relevant features from TikTok video metadata and content to improve classification accuracy.

**Decision Tree Model:**
Implements a Decision Tree classifier, a interpretable machine learning model that partitions data into hierarchical decision nodes based on feature values.

**Model Interpretability:**
Provides insights into how the decision tree model makes classification decisions, which aids in understanding the factors influencing claim vs. opinion classification.
